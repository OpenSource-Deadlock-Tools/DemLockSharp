# DemLock benchmarks

This folder contains benchmark demos for the parser, sourced from
tournaments whose files are available publically. The files are named according to the format
`benchmark_<YYYYMMDD>_<commit>.dem`, where `YYYYMMDD` is the day the match
was played and `commit` is the [SteamDatabase/Protobufs](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs) commit
of the version of protobuf being used.
