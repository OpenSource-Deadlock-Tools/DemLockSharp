# Demlock: Demo Parser for Deadlock

## NOTE: THIS IS HEAVILY WIP RIGHT NOW

This is a demo parser the is being created in C# for the express purposes of taking dead lock demo files (.dem) and parsing them to extract useful stats and information.

Right now this project is at the very start, but is quickly being brought up with reference to parsers for other valve games.



### Resources
This project is being built and maintained by the Devlock open source community, if you have questions or would like to join in on learning about demo files, you can find our discord below
